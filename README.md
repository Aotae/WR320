# Audience Analysis:
## Audience: Non-specialist students i.e. have never touched git before / non-cs students.
> ```The Audience requires non-technical vocab and little to no jargon; if jargon is used, it should be followed with an explanation of what that jargon means. The Audience’s interests should be how to use GitHub efficiently so that they can cooperate with a technical team (programmers/cs-students) when working in groups. The instruction set is to be clear and concise so that anyone from any cultural background and/or educational background can understand the steps to use GitHub.```

# Instructions on how to get started with GitHub

### Intro:
---
GitHub and Git in general is a great way to collaborate with teammates on projects of all sizes big and small. This guide will help you get started in a quick and efficient manner for beginners. Other uses for GitHub are under the "Uses and Helpful Information" tab at the end of the document for your perusal. 

### Step 1: Create a GitHub account:
---
In order to get started, you must create a GitHub account if you don't have one. Go to github.com and click on the "Sign up" button. Follow the prompts to create a new account, which will require you to provide a username, email address, and password.

### Step 2: Create a new repository
---
With your new GitHub account, you can now create a new repository, a repository is a central location in which your data and code can stored and managed.
- Click on the "+" icon in the top right corner of the GitHub dashboard and select "New repository" from the drop-down menu.
- Give your repository a name and a brief description, and select whether you want the repository to be public or private. For demonstration purposes choose public.
- Then click the "Create repository" button.


### Step 3: Set up the repository
---
Once you have created the repository, you need to set it up. You will see a page with instructions on how to set up your repository with Git. You can either follow those instructions or skip them if you don't plan to use Git.

### Step 4: Adding files to the repository  
---
To add files to your repository, you can either upload files directly to GitHub or use a Git client to push files to your repository. 
- To upload files directly to GitHub, click the "Add file" button and select "Upload files." You can then drag and drop files from your computer or browse for files to upload. Once you have uploaded your files, you can commit your changes by adding a commit message and clicking the "Commit changes" button.

###  Step 5: Manage the repository
---
You can manage your repository using the GitHub interface. You can edit files, create branches, and merge changes from other contributors.
- To edit a file, click on the file in the repository and click the "Edit" button. You can then make changes to the file and commit your changes.
- To create a new branch, click the "Branch" button and enter a name for the branch. You can then make changes to the branch without affecting the main branch.
- To merge changes from other contributors, you can create a pull request and review the changes before merging them into the main branch.

### Step 6: Collaborate with others/ Add Group Members
---
One of the main benefits of using GitHub is collaboration. You can invite other people to contribute to your repository by adding them as collaborators. To do this,
- Go to the repository settings and click on the "Collaborators" tab.
- You can then enter the GitHub usernames of the people you want to invite as collaborators. Once they accept the invitation, they can contribute to your repository by making changes to files and creating pull requests.

# Uses and helpful information

### Use GitHub for version control

GitHub is also useful for version control, which allows you to keep track of changes to your code/documents over time. Each time you make a change to your repository, GitHub creates a commit that records the changes you made. You can view the history of your repository by clicking on the "Commits" tab. You can also revert to a previous commit if you need to undo changes you made.

### Use GitHub for issue tracking

GitHub also includes an issue tracking system that allows you to keep track of bugs, feature requests, and other issues related to your repository. To create an issue, click on the "Issues" tab and click the "New issue" button. You can then enter a title and description for the issue and assign it to a person or a milestone. You can also add labels to categorize issues and add comments to discuss the issue with other contributors. Once an issue is resolved, you can close it and mark it as completed.

### Use GitHub for documentation

GitHub also provides tools for creating and hosting documentation for your project. You can create a wiki page for your project by clicking on the "Wiki" tab and clicking the "Create the first page" button. You can then add content to the page using Markdown, a simple markup language for formatting text. You can also use GitHub Pages to host a website for your project. To do this, go to the repository settings and click on the "Pages" tab. You can then choose a theme and publish your website.

### Stay organized with project boards

GitHub also offers project boards to help you stay organized and keep track of tasks related to your project. You can create a project board by clicking on the "Projects" tab and clicking the "Create a project" button. You can then add columns to the project board to represent different stages of your project, such as "To do," "In progress," and "Completed." You can then add cards to each column to represent tasks or issues related to your project.

# Conclusion

GitHub is just one of many ways for a User to use git and while this tutorial may help you get started with setting up your first repository it hasn't covered how to use git from the command line which is the premier way of using git in the software development world. There are other solutions such as Graphical User Interfaces in the form of Desktop Applications which can also use git to interface with GitHub or your repository service of choice. Some that I would recommend include gitkraken and GitHub Desktop other repository solutions you might come across are things like bitbucket or gitlab. None of these things are covered in this tutorial but I encourage you to look into these with your new found knowledge on how to use GitHub from a Web Client.
